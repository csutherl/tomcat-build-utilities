# This script will convert the timestamps (created by using -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamp) in a GC log to a human readable format, "starttime + $delta mins"
# Example:
# 
# 0.083: Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0000608 seconds, Stopping threads took: 0.0000120 seconds
#
# would be:
#
# "starttime + 0.00138333 mins" Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0000608 seconds, Stopping threads took: 0.0000120 seconds
